#### In preparation for this week:
* read/listen/watch as much as you can from the annotated materials below

### the Agile methodology 

It all started with the [__Agile Manifesto__](https://agilemanifesto.org) for developing software. It contnues to influence most activities that use code, and stir passions. Some swear by the Agile methodology, while others swear it's not a great idea for Data Science work.  (Not surprisingly, one of us is a big believer in the Agile way, but the other is a big believer in only implementing Agile-like principles when it makes sense). The jury is still out on __Agile__, but precisely for that reason you should understand what it is and what makes it attractive in the field. A few recommended posts will help you get there.

Start by reading [__The Psychology of Agile__](https://medium.com/agile-in-learning/the-psychology-of-agile-87f92521a5ed) that summarizes the benefits that people perceive from the **Agile** way. Read also [__Stop Brainstorming and Start Sprinting__](https://medium.com/@jakek/stop-brainstorming-and-start-sprinting-16180839b43d) about what a **sprint** is, how it works, and why it's useful, but don't forget to read a complementary perspective in [__From Agile to Fragile: How to unravel your team in one sprint__](https://medium.com/agile-in-learning/from-agile-to-fragile-how-to-unravel-your-team-in-one-sprint-5e60e70a557) on how and where sprints can go wrong. An incredibly helpful reading is [**Don’t Make Data Scientists Do Scrum**](https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-make-data-scientists-do-scrum-de87bc921a6b) that makes a seasoned and compelling argument explaining why it may not always be the path to follow for Data Science. For a more formal argument, read Kery & Meyers' (2017) article - [__Exploring Exploratory Programming__](https://marybethkery.com/projects/Verdant/ExploringExploratoryProgramming.pdf) - that details the kind of programming activities that are common to the work of Data Scientists and engineers working with data. Wrap up with [__MVP Paradox And Here’s How To Fix Your MVP Before Its Too Late!__](https://hackernoon.com/mvp-paradox-and-what-most-founders-need-to-be-aware-of-3a5f8c3acb76) on how to think about minimum viable products (**MVPs**).
